# Concrete Strength Prediction with EBM

This application predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on its material content using an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM). It provides a user-friendly interface to input material properties and view the predicted strength.

## Features
- Predict concrete compressive strength
- Interactive web interface
- Easy to use input sliders for each concrete component

## Setup and Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/ConcreteStrengthPredictor.git
cd ConcreteStrengthPredictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
